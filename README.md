# Project 1
Finished Python project 1

In our project we will conduct a basic descriptive economic of Danish GDP and it's components. To do this, we used DST data for danish private consumption, public consumption, investments, imports and exports. We will derive net export from import and export, derive total GDP as a sum of our variables. In the end we will make a graph which shows development of GDP and its variables.
